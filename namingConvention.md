## CSS Naming Convention


## Existing id's & classes
 ID 'main-container' used on div for rendering content (not header or footer) in index.html
 IDs used for 'single campsite' CSS (4 rows, 2 columns):
    'single-campsite-header'
    'single-campsite-image'
    'single-campsite-types' (same row as amenities)
    'single-campsite-amenities' (same row as types)
    'single-campsite-reviews'
classes used for 'single campsite' css:
    'types-amenities-ul' (to display a list/bullets of camp attributes nicely)
    'review-ul' (to format the elements of a review)
